    <h1>7th of January, 2026 — A Winter Walk</h1>
    <div class="date">7th of January, 2026</div>

    <p>
        I walked through the winter night for more than three hours.  
        The cold was sharp—around 5°C—cutting through the silence.
    </p>

    <p>
        I was waiting to talk to a friend… but that didn’t happen.
    </p>

    <p>
        So I put on my headphones and started listening to music I hadn’t heard in years.  
        That’s when I realized how powerful music really is.  
        It doesn’t just play—it <span class="highlight">transports</span> you.
    </p>

    <p>
        In seconds, I was back in time.  
        Back in those moments.  
        Back in those places.
    </p>

    <p>
        I was in 2020.  
        I was in 2021.  
        I was in 2022.
    </p>

    <p>
        Lately, my personal life and my way of thinking have changed a lot.  
        I have dreams. I have goals.  
        And I’ve genuinely given my best to them.
    </p>

    <p>
        But sometimes, despite effort, reality doesn’t bend.
    </p>

    <p>
        There is a limit to how much effort one person can put in—especially when dreams begin to involve someone else.  
        You can only walk your side of the road.  
        The rest depends on whether the other person chooses to see… or chooses to stay blind while standing in a crowd.
    </p>

    <p>
        I did everything I possibly could from my side.  
        Now the only thing left is distance—
        distance that might someday show her the damage she’s done to herself by choosing comfort over courage, ease over growth.
    </p>

    <p>
        I hope she realizes it one day.  
        Before it’s too late.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sometimes people only understand fire <span class="highlight">after</span> they’re burned—  
        after realizing that the friend who tried to stop them wasn’t against them…  
        he was trying to save them.
    </p>

    <p>
        All these thoughts stayed with me as I kept walking through the freezing night, music in my ears, silence all around—  
        steadying myself for the challenges ahead,  
        pulling myself back onto my path,  
        back to my dreams.
    </p>

    <p>
        I carry full responsibility for my life and my future.  
        I’ve taken time from my parents and earned their trust by telling them I’m working toward something real.  
        I cannot waste that trust.
    </p>

    <p>
        So I have to move forward—no matter what.
    </p>

    <p>
        I need to work.  
        I cannot become part of the crowd.  
        I cannot end up back in the same broken place I was after college.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have a life to live—a <span class="highlight">precious</span> life.  
        I want the best from it.  
        Not to waste it.  
        Not to surrender it to easy choices or mediocrity.
    </p>

    <p>
        I want great places.  
        Great surroundings.  
        Great people.  
        Great wealth—of mind, opportunity, and yes, money too.
    </p>

    <p>
        And I know this kind of life demands something rare:  
        being extraordinary,  
        working relentlessly,  
        showing up consistently.
    </p>

    <p>
        Exploring.  
        Moving forward.  
        Attempting what feels impossible.
    </p>

    <p>
        If living truly means anything, it means <span class="highlight">not settling for less</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
        I will carve my own way through this world—  
        jumping toward the best,  
        learning from the best,  
        gathering the best,  
        and shaping from it a life that is fully mine.
    </p>
